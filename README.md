# Volume Weighted Average Price

## Introduction

The methodology discussed in this paper aims towards achieving the goal of optimizing a given trade order for a given capital, at a given instance. When the model is requested for the best optimal exchange for a given trade capital, the alogrithm analyses the Level 2 Order Book data for various exchanges and selects the best exchange among the available exchanges based Volume Weighted Average Price method. Also, the paper introduces another alternative method of considering Volume Weighted Standard Deviation which considers the exchanges with tighter bid/ask spreads as optimal exchange to trade.
